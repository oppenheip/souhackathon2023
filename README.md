Shake Up Shakespeare.

Created by Professor Priscilla Oppenheimer 3/28/2023 for the SOU Hackathon.

This is a mini-website that has Romeo and Juliet activities. One activity randomly generates Romeo and Juliet dialog. Another activity is a Romeo and Juliet quiz. Art was made with Midjourney and DALL-E2.

Don't judge me! :-) Seriously, don't judge this submission.

To start this "app" download all the files and open shake.html in a web browser. Or, if you prefer, you can see it running on my web server here:
