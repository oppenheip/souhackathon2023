This website was developed by <a href="http://www.priscilla.com" target="_blank">Priscilla Oppenheimer</a> as part of the Southern Oregon University 2023 <a href="https://nimogen.github.io/SOU2023Hackathon/" target="_blank">hackathon</a>.
Her students did much, much better projects than she did. :-)<br>
<p>
Priscilla loves <a href="http://shakespeare.mit.edu/romeo_juliet/full.html" target="_blank">Romeo and Juliet</a> and everything related to Shakespeare, which is good because she lives in beautiful <a href="https://traveloregon.com/places-to-go/cities/ashland/" target="_blank">Ashland, Oregon</a>, home of the renowned <a href="https://www.osfashland.org" target="_blank">Oregon Shakespeare Festival.</a><br>
<p>
Priscilla created the images for this website using <a href="https://www.midjourney.com" target="_blank">Midjourney</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2" target="_blankk">DALL-E2</a> artificial intelligence. The above image of Juliet is what Priscilla wishes she still looked like. :-)
